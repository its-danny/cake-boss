## Features

### Customizable out the wazoo

- Prefix, branding, log channel, usage, etc. Don't like cake? Give hot dogs! 🌭
- Role-based permissions for commands where it makes sense, blacklist for the rest.
- Full control over how many cakes people can give out, and how often.
- A quiet mode to make Cake Boss respond with reacts instead of messages whenever possible.

### Easy to use prizes

- Encourage helpfulness by creating prizes that can be redeemed with cake.
- Nothing more than a description and optional role.
- Can be redeemed through a reaction-based menu that's quick and easy to use.
- Any prize with a role attached will be given automatically, otherwise a redeem event will be logged to a log channel for mods to reward.

### Leaderboard

There's not a lot to say about this. Who doesn't want to shove their rank in everyone else's face?

## Running It Yourself

I'm too lazy to dive into this, but if you've used Node & PostgreSQL then it shouldn't take too much to get it going. Just copy `.env.sample` to `.env`, take a look at `package.json`, and go from there.
