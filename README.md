# 🍰 Cake Boss

> A discord bot that lets users reward each other cakes for being helpful, and redeem those cakes for prizes.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dannytatom/cake-boss.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dannytatom/cake-boss)

## Features

### Customizable out the wazoo

- Prefix, language, log channel, etc. Don't like cake? Give hot dogs! 🌭
- Role-based permissions for commands where it makes sense, blacklist for the rest.
- Full control over how many cakes people can give out, and how often.

### Easy to use prizes

- Encourage helpfulness by creating prizes that can be redeemed with cake.
- Nothing more than a description and optional role.
- Can be redeemed through a reaction-based menu that's quick and easy to use.
- Any prize with a role attached will be given automatically, otherwise a redeem event will be logged to a log channel for mods to reward.

### Leaderboard

There's not a lot to say about this. Who doesn't want to shove their rank in everyone else's face?

## Get Started

Check the [docs](https://dannytatom.github.io/cake-boss/) for how to use it then [Add Cake Boss](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=611013950942871562&scope=bot&permissions=335555648) to your Discord server.

## Running It Yourself

I'm too lazy to dive into this, but if you've used Node & PostgreSQL then it shouldn't take too much to get it going. Just copy `.env.sample` to `.env`, take a look at `package.json`, and go from there.
